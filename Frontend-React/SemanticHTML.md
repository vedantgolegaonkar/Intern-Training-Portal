# What is Semantic HTML ?

Semantic HTML refers to using HTML tags and elements that convey the meaning and structure of the content they contain. These elements 
are designed to provide information about the content's role or purpose, improving both readability and accessibility for users and search 
engines.

## Key Features of Semantic HTML

### 1. Meaningful Markup:

- Semantic elements clearly describe their content. For example:
  
   `<header>`: Represents a page or section header.
  
   `<article>`: Represents a self-contained piece of content.
  
   `<footer>`: Represents a page or section footer.
  
   `<nav>`: Represents navigation links.
  
### 2. Improved Accessibility:
- Assistive technologies, like screen readers, can interpret semantic elements more effectively, improving the experience for users with disabilities.


### 3. SEO Benefits:
- Search engines understand the page structure better, enhancing its visibility and ranking.


### 4. Readability for Developers:
- The code is easier to read and maintain, as the purpose of elements is clear.

## Examples of Semantic vs. Non-Semantic HTML

#### Non-Semantic HTML :

``` bash
<div id="header">Welcome to My Website</div>
<div id="content">This is the main content area.</div>
<div id="footer">© 2024 My Website</div>
```

#### Semantic HTML :

``` bash
<header>Welcome to My Website</header>
<main>This is the main content area.</main>
<footer>© 2024 My Website</footer>
```
